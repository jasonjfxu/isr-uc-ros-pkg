Welcome to the [ISR](http://www.isr.uc.pt) - [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt) [ROS](http://www.ros.org/wiki/) repository!

[Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://www.ros.org/wiki/) is currently being developed by [Willow Garage](http://www.willowgarage.com/) and Stanford. Here you have adopted this system as the main base for our robots and since then we have been developing several packages.
